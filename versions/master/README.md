# API Specification
This specification is intended to define a standardized way of communicating real-time command-and-control data and to allow data collection between control systems and / or peripheral devices.

# Scope

The scope of this document is limited to providing a payload structure and endpoint type definitions to allow basic control and data acquisition. This document does not set out to define an API but rather to specify a uniform way to build one. It does not seek to dictate endpoint names, server architecture, or security protocols.  The addition of product specific features is left to the implementer, but to be in compliance the product must support the basic set of features specified below.

# Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 of the OpenAPI specification.

# Common Concepts

There are specific concepts that all participants in this open API must support in order to make interaction possible. Each of these concepts should be driven by factory configurations or by on-site configurations made by the customer or a professional integrator.  

Compliance with the Open-Agtech API requires adherence to the OpenAPI Specification (currently [3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md)).

# OpenAPI Specification

For convenience, we have included some of the more important and relevant concepts of the OpenAPI spec. While the complete spec is not located here, these concepts will provide a foundation for building a compliant API.

### Open AgTech API Document

The Open AgTech API Document describes the structure of a compliant API. Documents MUST be in YAML or JSON format and SHOULD be accessible to consumers of the API. You can read more about the structure of the document at the [Open API Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#document-structure), or see examples (**TODO: EXAMPLES**)

In addition, there are several principles that account for the needs of our industry.

# URL construction

*Path elements within the URL...*
- The first element of all compliant apis MUST be "agroapi"
- The second element of all compliant apis MUST be the version number
- The third element of all compliant apis MUST be a domain identifier (e.g., "lights", "air", and so on)
- All elements after the third and before the final element are optional and SHOULD describe collections and / or a single member of a collection
- The final element of all compliant apis MUST identify the information or action that is the subject of the call

*Structure of collections...*
- Collection identifiers MUST be plural
- Endpoints SHOULD NOT nest more than 2 collections deep (e.g., collection/{id}/collection/{id})

*Data structures...*
- Individual data points coming from the same device SHOULD be grouped in a structure with other data points that are related to the same topic

# Error Handling

In principle, a successful API call should return an HTTP status code of 200. An unsuccessful API call will return an HTTP status code of 550 and the body should contain an error code that has been properly documented by the owner of the API.  

The interpretation of error codes, including the text describing the error, will be left up to the API user based on their understanding of the error code documentation provided by the API owner.

# Authentication

*TBD* We've agreed on Oauth

# Timestamps

All monitoring data MUST be accompanied by a timestamp in the RFC3339 format.

`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[Z|-HH:MM|+HH:MM]`

Here is an example of a properly formatted timestamp in UTC:

`2018-01-25T04:56:05Z`

And the same time in the NZST timezone:

`2018-01-25T04:56:05+12:00`

# Common Structures
Many concepts use the same data structures to report their essential information. Those structures are listed here.

# Examples

While there are multiple compliant ways to adhere to the API specification, we have compiled examples of API implementations to assist those who may be implementing for the first time.

* [Lights](lights.md) - specifies the API for interacting with lighting systems
* [Air](air.md) - specifies the API for interacting with air control systems (heating, cooling, ventilation, humidity, and so on)
